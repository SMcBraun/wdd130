                "Each temple is a beacon of light and hope. The temple, the House of the Lord,
                stands as a symbol of our faith in life after death and as a stepping stone to
                eternal life for us and our
                families. The temple is a sacred and essential part of God’s plan for our happiness,
                now and forever."
                - Russell M. Nelson, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints

            <h2>Temple History</h2>
            <p>
                The Laie Hawaii Temple holds a unique place in Church history as the first
                temple built
                outside the continental United States. Dedicated on November 27, 1919 by Heber J
                Grant,
                it's the oldest operating temple outside of Utah and the fifth
                oldest temple still in operation worldwide. This sacred edifice brought the
                blessings of
                temple ordinances closer to the members of the Pacific, serving as a beacon of faith
                and devotion for generations.
